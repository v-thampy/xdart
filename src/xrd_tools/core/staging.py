"""RAM-aware sizing for the live heavy-staging caps (MEM-2).

One function decides the window; the three live heavy caps consume it —
``LiveFrameSeries._in_memory_cap`` (write-side staging), and the
``max_heavy_items`` of both ``FrameRecordStore`` and ``PublicationStore``.
Before MEM-2 all three hardcoded ``64``.

The window is ~25% of TOTAL physical RAM (total, not available — stable and
predictable across machines) divided by the AS-STORED per-frame heavy cost,
clamped to ``[16, 64]``.  A tiny detector never shrinks it below today's 64; a
small-RAM box shrinks it toward 16 so the staging set can't exhaust memory.

Pure + headless: only stdlib ``os`` (RAM detection), no numpy / Qt.
