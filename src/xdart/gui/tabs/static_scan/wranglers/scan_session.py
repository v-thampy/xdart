"""``ScanSessionAdapter`` — xdart's bridge over a streaming ReductionSession.

Phase 4c-1: the per-frame register+submit, the pause quiesce, and the
sink flush that were inlined in ``imageWranglerThread`` move behind one
object that wraps a streaming ``ReductionSession`` + its ``QtNexusSink``.
It owns the three irreducibly-xdart concerns the headless session can't:
the LiveFrame→Frame submit, the Qt-side stop-on-write-failure translation
(never raise into the wrangler ``run()`` loop — that tears down the
QThread), and the h5pool-bracketed sink flush.

It strictly DELEGATES quiesce to ``ReductionSession.pause`` (4a) — it never
reimplements drain — and never writes the sink itself (the session's single
writer thread does), preserving the HDF5 single-writer invariant.

**Status (4f-bridge, landed):** this adapter now wraps the PUBLIC
``xrd_tools.session.ScanSession`` (built by ``open_live_scan_session``), not a
raw ``ReductionSession`` — xdart is thin over the headless session.  ``submit``
→ ``ScanSession.submit`` (bool), ``quiesce`` → ``ScanSession.pause`` (drain +
flag), ``resume`` → ``ScanSession.resume``, ``is_paused``/``is_running`` are its
properties.  The GI streaming matrix + the live≡batch≡reload equivalence spine
+ byte-compat all stay green through it.

The live DISPLAY still flows GUI-side through ``QtNexusSink`` (the session
forwards every sink hook via its internal ``_EventSink``).  Routing display
through the session's ``on_frame_completed`` event channel
(QueuedConnection-marshalled, lossy subscriber) + mapping ``on_state_change`` →
``sigPaused``/``sigResuming`` is the OPTIONAL Part B, deferred behind a manual
live checkpoint; the architectural "thin over the public session" goal is met
without it.
